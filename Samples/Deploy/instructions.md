## Deploy Cloud Code Script

Run command from [Samples/Deploy] directory:
```
ugs deploy ./CloudCode/Script
```
You will find [Script.js] published in your dashboard for the configured project and environment. The command deploys supported contents in `CloudCode/Script` directory. 

### Create Cloud Code Script

To create a deployable cloud code script, you need `module.exports` and `module.exports.params` in your script:

```JS
module.exports = async ({ params, context, logger }) => {
  // Please define your script logic
}

// Please define your script parameters
module.exports.params = {
    range: "NUMERIC"
};
```
Please take [Script.js] as an example. For more details, please check [Declare parameters in the script].

## Deploy Cloud Code Module

Run command from [Samples/Deploy] directory:
```
ugs deploy ./CloudCode/Module
```
You will find [Module.ccm] published in your dashboard for the configured project and environment. The command deploys supported contents in `CloudCode/Module` directory. 

### Create Cloud Code Module

To create a deployable cloud code module, you need either a `.ccm` file or a `.sln`. When deploying a `.sln` file the entry point project will be determined by the publish profile.

Please take [Module.ccm] as an example. For more details, please check [Create a Module Project] or [Create a Module Project using the CLI].

## Deploy Remote Config

Run command from [Samples/Deploy] directory:
```
ugs deploy ./RemoteConfig
```
You will find all the keys in [configuration.rc] published in your dashboard for the configured project and environment. The command deploys support contents in `RemoteConfig` directory.

### Create Remote Config Files:

To create a deployable remote config file, you need a `.rc` file with the following pattern:
```Json
{
  "$schema": "https://ugs-config-schemas.unity3d.com/v1/remote-config.schema.json",
  "entries": {
    "your-unique-config-key": 100.2
  },
  "types" : {
    "your-unique-config-key": "FLOAT"
  }
}
```
Please take [configuration.rc] as an example. For more details, please check [Remote Config files].

## Deploy Economy

Run command from [Samples/Deploy] directory:
```
ugs deploy ./Economy
```

You will find the resource from [CURRENCY.ecc], [INVENTORY_ITEM.eci], [VIRTUAL_PURCHASE.ecv] and [REAL_MONEY_PURCHASE.ecr] published in your dashboard for the configured project and environment.

### Create Economy Files
There are 4 file formats for Economy:
- `.ecc` for Currency
- `.eci` for Inventory Item
- `.ecr` for Real Money Purchase
- `.ecv` for Virtual Purchase

All of the files, regardless of type, should contain a json containing the required information for the specific Economy resource. You can find out what information to put in each file by looking at the [Economy resource schemas].

Some fields may be omitted from the resource file, such as `type` (inferred by file extension), `id` (defaults to be equal to name), `customData` and other optional fields.

### File Content Examples
File: GOLD.ecc
```Json
{
  "name": "GOLD",
  "initial": 10,
  "max": 1000
}
```

Check out examples for [CURRENCY.ecc], [INVENTORY_ITEM.eci], [VIRTUAL_PURCHASE.ecv] and [REAL_MONEY_PURCHASE.ecr].

## Deploy Leaderboards

Run command from [Samples/Deploy] directory:
```
ugs deploy ./Leaderboards
```
You will find the resource from [lbsample.lb] published in your dashboard for the configured project and environment.

### Create Leaderboards Files:

To create a deployable leaderboards file, you need a `.lb` file with the following pattern:
```Json
{
  "$schema": "https://ugs-config-schemas.unity3d.com/v1/leaderboards.schema.json",
  "SortOrder": "asc",
  "UpdateType": "keepBest",
  "Name": "My Leaderboard",
  "ResetConfig": {
    "Start": "2023-08-25T00:00:00-04:00",

```
ugs deploy ./Access
```
You will find the resource from [sample-policy.ac] published in your dashboard for the configured project and environment.

### Create Matchmaker Files

To create a deployable access file,
you need `.mme` and `.mmq` files, each containing a json with the required information for the specific resource.

File Schemas:
- [Matchmaker Environment Config resource schema]
- [Matchmaker Queue resource schema]

Please take [environment-config.mme] and [queue.mmq] as examples.
For more details, please check the [Matchmaker Admin API].

## Deploy all Samples
Run command from [Samples/Deploy] directory:
```
ugs deploy .
```
